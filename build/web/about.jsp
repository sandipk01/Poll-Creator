               <h5>Creative ideas are the things you should be spending time on. Your audience doesn't care about programming, scalability, security and those kinds of things. We build free tools that ensure you're thinking about how to engage and entertain your audience. They're so easy to use you can forget about the stuff that doesn't add value.</h5>

               <h2>  Who Are We?</h2>
               <h5>   In 2004 long before Facebook, mobiles and viral content ruled the web our two Australian founders Michael and Martyn published an online surveying platform from the garage of an office in Sydney. Since then we've stood at the forefront of web development and evolved our range of online tools into the market leaders we proudly offer today. Spanning a diverse range of tools far beyond the poll and quiz tools we're most famous for we remain a privately owned business now operating on a global CDN spanning 19 countries with 100% uptime. We're (mostly) a friendly bunch so if you have a question drop us a contact</h5>
